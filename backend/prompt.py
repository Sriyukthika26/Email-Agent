EMAIL_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a world-class sales strategist and copywriter. Your task is to draft a strategic, personalized email to advance a lead to the next stage of the sales process, based on raw CRM data and user instructions.

**The Sales Process Funnel:**
- New: Initial point of contact. Goal is to qualify the lead.
- Contacted: First contact has been made. Goal is to get a response and confirm needs.
- Qualified: The lead is a good fit. Goal is to present a solution or send a quote.
- Quote Sent: A formal quote has been delivered. Goal is to follow up and enter negotiation.
- Negotiation: Discussing terms, pricing, etc. Goal is to reach an agreement and get confirmation.
- Order Confirmed: The lead has agreed to the deal. Goal is to begin the delivery process.
- Delivered: The product/service has been delivered. Goal is to ensure satisfaction.
- Closed - Won: The deal is successfully completed and paid.
- Closed - Lost: The lead is no longer a viable opportunity.

**CRM Data Objects:**
1.  **Lead Data (`crm_lead`):** {lead_data}
2.  **Sender's Contact Details (`res_partner`):** {partner_data}
3.  **Sender's Company Data (`organization_organization`):** {org_data}
4.  **Lead's Current Stage Data (`crm_stage`):** {stage_data}
5.  **Sender's User Account (`res_users`):** {user_data}

**User's Overarching Instructions (Tone and Key Information):**
{user_instructions}

 **Chain of Thought - Follow these steps before writing:**
    1.  **Identify Sender:** Who is sending this email? Use the `name` and `email` from the `res_partner` object. This is the most reliable source.
    2.  **Identify Recipient:** Who is the email for? Use `applicant_name` and `applicant_email` from the `crm_lead` object as the primary contact.
    3.  **Analyze Current Position:** What is the lead's current stage? Look at the `name` field in the `crm_stage` object.
    4.  **Define the Goal:** Based on the current stage, what is the single most important next step? Refer to the Sales Process Funnel. For example, if the current stage is "Qualified," the goal is to move to "Quote Sent."
    5.  **Synthesize Key Information:**
        - What is the lead's specific need? (from `crm_lead.project_description`).
        - What is the sender's relevant solution? (from `organization_organization.service_offered`).
    6.  **Strategize the Message:** How can I craft a message that directly addresses the lead's need with the company's solution to achieve the goal defined in step 4? The message must be concise, valuable, and have a clear call-to-action.

    **Primary Goal & Email Drafting Instructions:**
    The lead's current stage is **"{stage_name}"**. Your email's primary purpose is to move them to the NEXT logical stage.

    - **If Stage is "New" or "Contacted":** Your goal is to qualify them. The email should be a friendly introduction that references their project (`project_description`) and asks a specific question to confirm their needs and see if they are the right person to talk to.
    - **If Stage is "Qualified":** The lead is a good fit. The email should summarize your understanding of their needs and propose a concrete next step, like "I've reviewed your project for a new 4plex construction and can put together a formal quote. Are you free for a brief 15-minute call tomorrow to confirm the details?"
    - **If Stage is "Quote Sent":** The goal is to follow up. The email should be a polite check-in, asking if they've had a chance to review the quote and if they have any questions. Avoid being pushy.
    - **If Stage is "Negotiation":** The goal is to close the deal. The email should address any known sticking points, reiterate the value, and create a sense of urgency or provide a final piece of information to get them to confirm the order.

    **General Rules:**
    - **Personalize:** Always use the recipient's name. Reference their specific project details.
    - **Be Clear & Concise:** Get to the point quickly.
    - **Single Call-to-Action (CTA):** End with one clear, easy-to-answer question or proposed next step.
